#Project Overview:

This project is a real-time weather monitoring system using React for the frontend, Material-UI for styling and interface design, and the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data. The system collects weather data in real-time for selected Indian metros and processes it to generate daily summaries, including key metrics like average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. It also includes user-configurable alerts for extreme weather conditions.

The application provides a sleek, responsive user interface to display current weather conditions, daily summaries, and triggered alerts using Material-UI components.

Project Summary: Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates
Project Overview:
This project is a real-time weather monitoring system using React for the frontend, Material-UI for styling and interface design, and the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data. The system collects weather data in real-time for selected Indian metros and processes it to generate daily summaries, including key metrics like average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. It also includes user-configurable alerts for extreme weather conditions.

The application provides a sleek, responsive user interface to display current weather conditions, daily summaries, and triggered alerts using Material-UI components.

#Key Design Choices:

Weather Data Source:

The system retrieves real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for key metro cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad).
Data such as temperature, perceived temperature, and weather condition are processed and displayed.
Data Processing & Aggregation:

The system computes daily aggregates like the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and determines the dominant weather condition for the day.
Temperature values are converted from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit, based on user preference).
Alert System:

Users can set alert thresholds (e.g., when the temperature exceeds a certain value) to monitor significant weather changes.
Alerts are triggered when thresholds are breached and displayed prominently in the UI.
UI Design & User Experience:

Material-UI is used for consistent, modern UI components.
The weather data and alerts are displayed in a visually appealing format, with easy-to-read cards and charts for weather trends.


#Dependencies:

Frontend Dependencies:

React: Main library for building the user interface.

Material-UI (MUI): React UI framework for designing the application with responsive and reusable components.

Axios: For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.

date-fns: For formatting and manipulating date and time values.


#API Design:

1) GET Weather Data:

Makes API requests to OpenWeatherMap to fetch real-time weather data for each city. This data is processed and displayed in the app.

2) GET Daily Summary:

The application computes daily aggregates from the fetched data for temperature values and weather conditions. This is displayed as a daily summary card.
POST Alerts:

3) Users can configure temperature thresholds for receiving alerts when the conditions breach their set limits. The app keeps track of these and displays notifications if a threshold is breached.




#Running the Application:

1) Fetching Real-Time Weather Data:

The app will fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for the selected Indian metros.

2) Displaying Weather Summaries:

The daily weather summaries for each city, including aggregated temperatures and dominant weather conditions, are shown in the UI using Material-UI cards.

3) Managing Alerts:

Users can set and modify alert thresholds (e.g., temperature alerts) via the alert dialog. When thresholds are breached, alerts are triggered and displayed in the UI.

4) Visualizing Weather Trends:

Temperature trends are visualized using charts, allowing users to view historical weather data.

#Conclusion:

This React-based real-time weather monitoring system, with Material-UI for design, offers users the ability to track weather data and trends across key Indian metros. It allows for temperature alerts, aggregated daily summaries, and a user-friendly interface with clear visualizations. By using a modular design, the system can be easily extended to include more cities, data points, or advanced analytics features in the future.
